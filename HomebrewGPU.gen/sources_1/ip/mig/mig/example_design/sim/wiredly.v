// Device           : 7Series
// Design Name      : DDR2 SDRAM
// Purpose          :
//   This module provide the definition of a zero ohm component (A, B).
//
//   The applications of this component include:
//     . Normal operation of a jumper wire (data flowing in both directions)
//       This can corrupt data from DRAM to FPGA useful for verifying ECC function. 
//
//   The component consists of 2 ports:
//      . Port A: One side of the pass-through switch
//      . Port B: The other side of the pass-through switch

//   The model is sensitive to transactions on all ports.  Once a transaction
//   is detected, all other transactions are ignored for that simulation time
//   (i.e. further transactions in that delta time are ignored).

// Model Limitations and Restrictions:
//   Signals asserted on the ports of the error injector should not have
//   transactions occuring in multiple delta times because the model
//   is sensitive to transactions on port A, B ONLY ONCE during
//   a simulation time.  Thus, once fired, a process will
//   not refire if there are multiple transactions occuring in delta times.
//   This condition may occur in gate level simulations with
//   ZERO delays because transactions may occur in multiple delta times.
